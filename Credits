midilib is developed by Jim Menard, jim@jimmenard.com. Additional bug fixes
and suggestions have come from:

Mario Pehle <rubyforge.org@errorinitus.de>

    Noticed that the PolyPressure class used the misspelled constant
    POLY_PRESSSURE.

Mike Hall <m3ha11@rcn.com>

    Found errors in example scripts' $LOAD_PATH and a bug in sequence reading
    block callback arguments. Found a bug in meta events that caused
    "Object#type is deprecated" error messages.

Emanuel Borsboom <emanuel.borsboom@gmail.com>

    Found and fixed an error in PitchBend data encoding.

Christopher Rose <cmr@synopsys.com>

    Found bug in Track#recalc_delta_from_times.

Jari Williamsson <jari.williamsson@mailbox.swipnet.se>

    Contributed Measure and Measures, TimeSig and KeySig, and fixes to events.
    Added get_measures to Sequence. Added default implementation of
    key_signature in SeqReader. Contributed the measures_mbt.rb example.

Noah Thorp

    Found a bug in the code intended to make midilib work under Ruby 1.9.
    Found another bug in KeySig.data_as_bytes.

Zach Chadwick (zachad on Github)

    Reported a problem that led to a fix in the way that strings and byte
    arrays are handled and output in meta events.

Adam Murray (adamjmurray on Github)

    Found problem with Track#recalc_delta_from_times sorting, and wrote the
    fix that is incorporated there.

Shai Rosenfeld (shaiguitar on Github)

    Corrected missing block arg in README.

J (dark-panda on Github)

    Instead of monkeypatching ::Array, put sorting methods into new
    MIDI::Array subclass to avoid clashes with Rails apps.

Lucas lfzawacki (lfzawacki on Github)

    Found a bug in the MIDI::IO::SeqReader class: the pitch_bend method's
    msb and lsb parameters were reversed.

Parki <parki06780678@gmail.com>

    Reported failure of install.rb with newer versions of Ruby due to use of
    old 'ftools' standard library component.

Adam Murray (adamjmurray on Github)

    Submitted a patch that avoids writing empty data when writing tracks.

@dylee on Github

    Submitted a patch that improves key signature event code and to_s.

@willm on Github

    Suggested that Sequence.length_to_delta round the result instead of
    truncating it.

@kaorukobo on Github

    Fixed a bug where the delta offset of META_SEQ_NAME and META_COPYRIGHT
    events were incorrectly always set to 0. The delta time may be any
    value (although META_COPYRIGHT should normally be 0).

@rhelsing on Github

    Added the ability to save MIDI format 0 files.

Miika Alonen

    Updated midilib for Ruby 3.0 by fixing uses of Proc.
